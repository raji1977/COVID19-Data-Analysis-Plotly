This repository presents a comprehensive and interactive data analysis project focused on the global spread of COVID-19. The work is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, where the dataset is cleaned, processed and examined through a variety of visual techniques. Using Plotly Express, the project transforms raw COVID-19 statistics into clear, engaging and dynamic charts that help readers understand how the pandemic evolved across different countries and timelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                              
The notebook follows a simple and structured workflow that begins with importing the dataset and preparing the data for analysis. It then progresses into exploratory analysis, where trends in confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries are observed through interactive line charts, bar plots and scatter diagrams. The visualisations make it easy to compare regions, track spikes and dips in cases and identify meaningful patterns that may not be immediately visible in tabular data. The project also leverages Plotly’s interactive features, allowing users to hover, zoom and explore the charts intuitively.                                                                                                                                                                                                              
This project demonstrates how a combination of Python, Pandas and Plotly Express can turn a global-scale dataset into an insightful visual narrative. It can be used as a reference for beginners learning data analysis, students creating academic projects or anyone interested in the analytical side of the COVID-19 outbreak. The notebook also highlights how visual storytelling can simplify complex data and make insights more accessible and impactful.
